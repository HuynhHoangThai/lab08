# Firewall Lab Report

## Introduction

This lab involves setting up firewall rules on a router within a Docker Compose network environment. The network comprises two subnets, each with a web server, and is configured to allow communication between the subnets. The goal is to configure `iptables` on the router to meet specific security requirements.

## Network Configuration

The network configuration is as follows:

- There are two subnets.
- Each subnet has a web server (`badsite` and `iweb`).
- The router can route packets between the networks.
- Computers on one subnet can ping computers on the other subnet.
- Computers on a subnet can telnet into computers on the other subnet except the web servers. The router can be telneted from computers on either subnet.

## Task Requirements

1. Block all access to the router except ping.
2. Prevent computers on subnet `10.9.0.0/24` from accessing the internal web server (`iweb`).
3. Block access to `badsite` from computers on subnet `172.16.10.0/24`.

## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `Network/firewall` folder.

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/quang-ute/Security-labs.git>
cd Security-labs/Network/firewall
docker-compose up -d
```

1. Check container
    
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

### Step 2: Configure the Router

1. Connect to the router container:
    
    ```bash
    docker exec -it firewall_router /bin/bash
    
    ```

2. Set up the iptables rules.
    
    ### 2.1. Block all access to the router except ping:
    
    ```bash
    iptables -P INPUT DROP
    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT
    
    ```

    ### 2.2. Prevent access to the internal web server (`iweb`) from subnet `10.9.0.0/24`:
    
    ```bash
    iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.9.0.0/24 -d 10.9.0.10 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
    
    ```

    ### 2.3. Block access to `badsite` from subnet `172.16.10.0/24`:
    
    ```bash
    iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.16.10.0/24 -d 172.16.10.110 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
    
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](LAB08%20f5d9aa7dfb9442a79ed2b595d691f37e/Untitled%205.png)
    

### Step 3: Save the iptables Rules

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /etc/iptables
    
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](LAB08%20f5d9aa7dfb9442a79ed2b595d691f37e/Untitled%206.png)
    
2. Save the rules:
    
    ```bash
    iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
    
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](LAB08%20f5d9aa7dfb9442a79ed2b595d691f37e/Untitled%207.png)
    
3. Exit the container:
    
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    

## Verification

To verify the iptables rules are correctly set up, you can use the following commands:

1. Check the iptables rules in the router container:
    
    ```bash
    docker exec -it firewall_router /bin/bash
    iptables -L -v -n
    
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](LAB08%20f5d9aa7dfb9442a79ed2b595d691f37e/Untitled%208.png)
    
2. Verify that the rules are saved correctly:
    
    ```bash
    cat /mnt/d/rules.v4
    
    ```

## Conclusion

In this lab, we successfully set up and configured firewall rules on a router within a Docker Compose network environment to meet the specified security requirements. We blocked all access to the router except for ping, prevented access to the internal web server from a specific subnet, and blocked access to a malicious site from another subnet.
